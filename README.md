A small overview of each class you can play in the classes chc.

## Developing

Use `npm run dev` to start up a dev server, which will automatically refresh when you make changes to the source code. The `svelte-kit dev` command doesn't watch markdown files, so you'll have to refresh the page to see any changes in the markdown content.

Before committing, run `npm run format` to format everything with Prettier.
