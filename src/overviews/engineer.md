## Remote Controls

Shift left clicking on a lever will give you a **remote control** for that lever. This is a special item that, when right clicked, will flick the lever from any distance. You can see the coordinates of the lever in the lore of the item itself, but it can be more useful to use the `/uhc rename [name]` command to change the name of the lever you're currently holding to keep track of which is which.

_Note: If a lever controlled by a remote control is destroyed, the remote control will turn blue when used._

## Ore Components

Redstone ore will drop additional redstone components when broken, weighted by three different rarity categories: common, uncommon, and rare. Any given common item is twice as likely to appear as an uncommon one, and any uncommon item is five times as likely to appear as a rare one.

## You Don't Take Fall Damage

You don't take any fall damage.

_Note: When you would normally take damage from falling more than three blocks, instead, you don't._
