(diver description)

## Swimming

You can swim about 3 times faster than usual in water. You're also able to dive out of water, boosting you in the direction you're facing.

## Auto-MLG

When you would normally take fall damage, a bucket of water is placed under you, negating any damage. If you're sprinting while you hit the ground, you're also launched forward in the direction you're facing, allowing you to chain the ability.

## Passive Refill

If you hold an empty bucket in your hand for a few seconds, it fills up with water.

## Tridents

Any drowns you kill will drop a trident with riptide.
